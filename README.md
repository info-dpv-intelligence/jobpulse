# JobPulse ‚Äì Job Management Backend

A microservices-based job posting and application management system built with Java 17 and Spring Boot 3. Demonstrates modern backend architecture, event-driven design, and observability patterns.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

**Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Security (JWT)  
**Messaging:** Apache Kafka  
**Database:** PostgreSQL  
**Observability:** Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose  
**Testing:** JUnit 5  

## Architecture

**Microservices:**
- `auth-service`:
   _Handles user registration, login, and JWT token issuance with embedded roles. Each microservice enforces role-based access control by validating roles from the token._
- `job-service`:
   - **`job-creation-listing`**:
      _Handles job listings, job creation. Responsible for exposing job opportunities to users._
   - **`job-poster`**
      _Manages job posts from the perspective of the poster. Enables reviewing, updating, and managing applications submitted for owned job posts._
   - **`job-seeker`**
      _Manages job applications (includes updating submitted documents, status)._
- `alert-worker`:
   _Handles alerts and notifications (pending)_

## üîß Quick Start

### Environment Setup
1. **Copy environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Configure credentials in `.env`:**
   ```bash
   # Required: Set your Grafana password
   GRAFANA_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
   
   # Optional: Override default URLs if needed
   # GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Start services:**
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   make ENV=dev full-up
   ```
Apologies, the API specification configuration is under progress:

In the meantime

The auth-service is responsible for user registration/login and issuing JWT tokens
You can access it: 
   - Register: http://localhost:8080/v1/auth/register
   - Login: http://localhost:8080/v1/auth/login
      On successful login, you will receive {
    "accessToken": "accessToken",
    "refreshToken": "refreshToken"
}
The jobpostcreationlisting is avaiable for fetching and creating the job posts.
You can access it:
   Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
   GET: 
   - http://localhost:8081/v1/jobs?sortDirection=ASC
   POST:
   - http://localhost:8081/v1/jobs

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

**Metrics Collection:**
- Business metrics: *(planned for future implementation)*

**Monitoring Stack:**
- **Prometheus:** [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) - Metrics collection
- **Grafana:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - Dashboard
- **Jaeger:** [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) - Distributed tracing (__configuration pending_)
