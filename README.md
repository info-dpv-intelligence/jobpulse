## üöÄ Mission Statement
**JobPulse** is a modular, event-driven backend platform that allows companies to post job listings and manage applications, while users can discover and apply for jobs. The system supports role-based authentication, lifecycle management for job applications, real-time job alerts, and Kafka-based event processing ‚Äì designed to demonstrate scalable Java backend architecture, concurrency, and production readiness.

## üìå Problem Statement
Companies need scalable systems to handle job listings, applicant tracking, and communication workflows efficiently. JobPulse addresses this by providing a clean, backend-first platform with async notifications, lifecycle state tracking, and extensible service boundaries.

## üß† Tech Stack
- Java 17, Spring Boot 3
- Spring Security (JWT Auth)
- Kafka (event-based communication)
- PostgreSQL + Redis (persistence + caching)
- Docker + Docker Compose
- JUnit + Testcontainers
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## üì¶ Core Modules
- `auth-service`: Handles login/signup and role-based access.
- `job-service`: Manages job creation, listing, and Kafka event production.
- `application-service`: Tracks application state and publishes Kafka events.
- `alert-worker`: Listens for job events and sends simulated user alerts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jobpulse
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env

   ```

4. **Verify services are running**
   ```bash
   # Check container status
   docker ps
   
   # Test health endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health  # Auth Service
   curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health  # Job Service
   ```
