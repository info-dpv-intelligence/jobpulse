# JobPulse ‚Äì Job Management Backend

A microservices-based job posting and application management system built with Java 17 and Spring Boot 3. Demonstrates modern backend architecture, event-driven design, and observability patterns.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

**Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Security (JWT)  
**Messaging:** Apache Kafka  
**Database:** PostgreSQL  
**Observability:** Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose  
**Testing:** JUnit 5  

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

**Microservices:**
- `auth-service` (8080) - JWT authentication & user management
- `job-service` (8081) - Job posting CRUD with pagination
- `application-service` (8082) - Application management *(API in progress)*
- `alert-worker` (8083) - Event processing *(implementation pending)*

**Infrastructure:**
- PostgreSQL databases per service
- Kafka for async event communication
- Full observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Comprehensive metrics collection with custom business metrics

## üìê Architecture Documentation

Detailed architecture diagrams and design documents are available in the `docs/` folder:

**Service-Specific Architecture:**
- [Auth Service Architecture](docs/auth-service/auth-service.puml) - Service structure and components
- [Registration & Login Flow](docs/auth-service/registration-login.puml) - Authentication workflow diagrams
- [Job Service Design](docs/job-service/design.puml) - Job management service architecture


## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

**Core Functionality:**
- User registration/login with JWT tokens
- Job posting creation and listing with pagination
- Role-based access control

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
- Kafka integration for service communication
- Event publishing for job lifecycle

**Observability & Monitoring:**
- Prometheus metrics collection with custom business metrics
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Jaeger distributed tracing
- Health checks (`/actuator/health`) 
- Real-time monitoring scripts
- Custom endpoint metrics with AOP

**API Documentation:**
- OpenAPI/Swagger for job-service
- Comprehensive endpoint documentation

## üîß Quick Start

```bash
# Start all services
make ENV=dev up

# Start observability stack
./start-observability.sh

# Health check
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
```

## üìã API Endpoints

**Auth Service (8080):**
```
POST /api/auth/register  # User registration
POST /api/auth/login     # Login with JWT response
GET  /actuator/prometheus # Prometheus metrics
```

**Job Service (8081):**
```
GET  /api/v1/jobs        # List jobs (paginated)
POST /api/v1/jobs        # Create job posting
GET  /actuator/prometheus # Prometheus metrics
```

**API Documentation:** [http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html)

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

**Metrics Collection:**
- Business metrics: Registration/login attempts, job searches, creation rates
- Technical metrics: Response times, error rates, JVM performance
- Database metrics: Connection pool usage, query performance

**Monitoring Stack:**
- **Prometheus:** [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) - Metrics collection
- **Grafana:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - Dashboards (admin/jobpulse123)
- **Jaeger:** [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) - Distributed tracing

**Real-time Monitoring:**
```bash
# Live metrics dashboard
./scripts/monitor.sh

# Validate observability setup
./scripts/validate-observability.sh

# Generate load for testing
./scripts/load-test.sh
```

## üöß To Be Implemented

- [ ] Job update/delete operations
- [ ] Advanced job search and filtering
- [ ] Application submission API (application-service)
- [ ] Application state tracking and file uploads
- [ ] Alert worker event processing
- [ ] Enhanced input validation and error handling
- [ ] Comprehensive integration test suite

*Note: This is a demonstration project.*
